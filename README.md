Gif is separated into smaller boxes with space between them and some border styles to give a little bit of a 3d look. 

When you click the magic button, the boxes animate and come together into one large box to display the gif with no separation.

Clicking the button again causes the animation to repeat while separating the large box back into several smaller ones.
