Gif is separated into smaller boxes with space between them and some border styles to give a little bit of a 3d look. 

When you click the magic button, the boxes animate and come together into one large box to display the gif with no separation.

Clicking the button again causes the animation to repeat while separating the large box back into several smaller ones.

One might assume the animation to be there hard part... but no, I had the hardest time getting the gif to display cleanly throughout multiple squares. Once I was able to understand that part, the rest was a piece of cake. Animations are always fun to play around with.

Oh, and why a corgi gif? Because corgis are the best!
